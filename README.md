# Ashes

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-Rust-orange?logo=rust&logoColor=%23FFFFFF)

This is a game jam repo, for [Devtober 2025](https://itch.io/jam/devtober-2025)! Ashes is a demo of a work-in-progress commercial project I've been working on for a few months now. This is written in Rust using only a few dependencies. Licensed under MIT, this repo aims to serve as an example of what "near production" Rust source code "should" look like for game development. It will still look pretty meh, but better than hastily vibe coded junk probably!

This is a demo, and a full game based around this is planned to be released onto Steam sometime before or during the 2025 Winter Sale, however due to external forces (being a fulltime university student) this may get pushed back, I will keep updated on that as needed.

## What *is* Devtober 2025?

It's an extremely lax and extremely fun game jam that takes place every October. The rules are very easy and can even be modified to fit how **you** develop this, and you can self-impose additional challenges during the month. This jam is not competitive, but more of a "personal challenge" to yourself to make something in those 30 days.

## Are *you* imposing rules on yourself?

Only a couple.

1. All assets must be created during the jam period.
2. Updates will be provided every 2-3 days to a personal [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@aheglock_7200).

## Wait, updates?

Yes! The jam encourages/requires consistent updates on the game for self imposed peer pressure. Quoting directly from their [website](https://itch.io/jam/devtober-2025):

> The point of posting on social media - daily or not - is not visibility or anything; it's because it's a passive peer pressure. You don't have to know if people care or not, or have any engagement target or even playing the social media game, but it's like, a way to pressure yourself.

These updates will start on *September 30th, 2025* and will conclude on *October 31st, 2025.* These updates will be fairly short and talking about what's being worked on and the plans for later. Most of these will likely be filmed on a uni campus so there will be background noise.

## Why Rust?

Rust is cool and I know it well enough to work in a commercial context with it. Not much else to say, really.
